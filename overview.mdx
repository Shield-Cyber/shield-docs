Shield is a commercial exposure management platform that proactively identifies risks within an organization’s attack surface, internal network, and identity landscape. Shield will perform automated scanning and auditing across the various levels of a company’s attack surface. The platform will capture risk trends over time, as well as provide guidance and solutions for various remediation actions based on what is discovered. Shield will also allow organizations to track and monitor aspects of the external, internal, and identity objects that make up their overall network.

<Accordion title="Internal Agent Deployment" icon="laptop">
    To perform agent based scanning, navigate to the [Deployment](https://platform.shieldcyber.io/deployment/internal-network) page and copy the subscription-specific PowerShell script out of the platform.  This PowerShell script can then be deployed to managed hosts with your preferred remote administration tool or technique.
