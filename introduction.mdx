Shield is a commercial exposure management platform that proactively identifies risks within an organization’s attack surface, internal network, and identity landscape. Shield will perform automated scanning and auditing across the various levels of a company’s attack surface. The platform will capture risk trends over time, as well as provide guidance and solutions for various remediation actions based on what is discovered. Shield will also allow organizations to track and monitor aspects of the external, internal, and identity objects that make up their overall network.

## Shield's Core Modules

**Attack Surface** - Where all of the vulnerability, asset, and service information for your internet-facing infrastructure is managed.

**Internal Network** - Where all of the vulnerability information and asset information for your hosts that are behind your firewall is managed.

**Identity Security**- Where all of the Active Directory (AD) objects - Users, Computers, Groups - are managed and where identity-based risks can be managed.
