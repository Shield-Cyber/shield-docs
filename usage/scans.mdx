title: "Scans"
description: "The Scans module allows users to create and control all network-based scanning for the target external attack surface assets and internal network assets."
---

The **Scanning** functionality is dedicated to creating, configuring, and managing network-based scans for deployed external and internal scanners that will target an organization's infrastructure and attempt to identify vulnerabilities.

Each subscription will come pre-configured with the ability to scan externally and should be setup with a dedicated attack surface scanner.

## Scan Creation

Users have the ability to create and configure network-based vulnerability scans against their external and internal network asset targets.  To create scans, users will need to follow the steps provided below: 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Target Creation">
    Targets and configurations need to be created and saved.  Specify the target name, IP address and/or Hostname, as well as the port list, alive test, and the location that the scan will be executed from.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scan Creation">
    Scans need to be created and tied to the targets that were generated from the initial step.  Enter a scan name and then select the created target(s) and scan configuration to assess the targets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch or Schedule Scans to Run">
    Once scans are created and are in the "New" state, users can navigate to the Scan Control or the Schedule page(s) to launch the initial scan on a one-time basis (Scan Control) or scheduled out to run at at designated time and frequency (Schedule).
  </Step>
