### Add Adjustments

To add a new adjustment, click the Add Adjustment button.  A subscription, risk level and a rationale are required.  Either an asset or a vulnerability are required, or both may be specified.  If an asset is selected without a vulnerability, then the adjustment applies to all vulnerabilities for the asset.  If a vulnerability is selected without an asset, then the adjustment applies to that vulnerabilities across all assets in the subscription.
