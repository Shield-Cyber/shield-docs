title: "Internal Network Scanning"
description: "The ability to configure and perform vulnerability scans against a single network or multiple network segments (or **locations**) can be accomplished by downloading and installing the Shield network vulnerability scanner within the target network location.  These scans will attempt to identify vulnerabilities against the targeted IP addresses, CIDR ranges, and/or domains."

## Scanner Deployment

<Note> Please note that the steps to deploy a Shield scanner has changed.  The latest streamlined deployment instructions can be found below.</Note>

The Shield scanner can be used for internal network vulnerability scans or discovery scans for different network locations where it can be deployed.

To install and link a dedicated Shield network scanner, users will need to do the following:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deploy a Dedicated Shield Scanner">
    Users should deploy a dedicated Shield scanner (Debian GNU/Linux OS preferred) to install the Shield scanner software on to perform network-based vulnerability scans.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute the Shield Scanner Installation Script">
    Navigate to the **Deployment** page, within the **Internal Network** tab, and click into the **Network-based** deployment pane.  Enter a location name for the scanner that is going to be deployed, copy the command out of the platform, and execute the script on the machine that has been setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the Scanner has been Successfully Linked">
    Navigate to the Settings page, under the Scanners > Shield tab and confirm that the scanner location deployed is linked to Shield.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Debian GNU/Linux OS Install (Preferred)
To install on a Debian Linux based OS, there is a single script that can be downloaded and executed to install and start the Shield service.  

#### Minimum Recommended Specs

|  Type | Specs  |
|---|---|
| CPU  | 4 2GHz cores |
|  Memory | 8 GB RAM  |
|  Disk Space | 50 GB (not including space used by the host OS) |

### Deployment

The consilidated **Deployment** page has now been configured to provided users with automated scripting to install and link scanners to the specified subscription.

To manage all of the deployments for the network-based scanners, please navigate to the [Internal Network Deployment](https://platform.shieldcyber.io/deployment/internal-network) page and click into the **Network-Based**, insert the **Location** value to generate the single deployment command to install the scanner.

</Frame>

Once these four (4) commands are ran successfully on the dedicated Shield scanner, the Shield service (ShieldCyber.Agent.Shield) will start and the scanner will begin to initialize and install the plugins required to perform vulnerability scans.  To confirm that the service is running successfully on the dedicated scanner, run the following command to view the service output:

`sudo service ShieldCyber.Agent.Shield status`

And the output of this command should state that the service is idle:

</Frame>

Once the service is running in the desired state, continue to link the scanner within the platform by navigating to **Settings** -> [**Scanners**](https://platform.shieldcyber.io/settings/scanners) to complete linking the scanner.

### Link Scanner

To use the scanner, it will need to be linked within the Shield platform.  To complete this step, navigate to the **Settings** -> [**Scanners](https://platform.shieldcyber.io/settings/scanners), click **New Configuration**, and then enter the following values, then save the created configuration:
  - **Location**: Select the location that was created for the scanner that is being linked.  The Shield service needs to be installed and running for the Location value to populate within the drop-down box.
  - **Password**: Enter the password that was created during the Shield scanner deployment process

Once the scanner is linked and the settings are saved, users can begin performing network-based vulnerability scans for the newly deployed scanner.  Proceed to the [**Scan Creation**](https://platform.shieldcyber.io/scan/creation) page to configure targets, create scans, and launch the scans to begin to assess the internal network for vulnerabilities.

### Network Communications

<Warning>Please note in order to communicate to the Shield Platform, outbound access over 443/tcp will need to be enabled to the following Shield Cyber API endpoint **https://shieldcyberapi.azurewebsites.net/api/**</Warning>

### Windows OS & MacOS Install

There are limitations installing the Shield scanner on Windows systems.  Specifically, to run the scanner, the Windows host needs to have Docker Desktop installed which can only run on Windows workstations.  Additionally, the installation process is not as automated as the Linux versions of the deployment.  Users with the Windows or MacOS version of the scanner will need to install the Shield service alongside the scanner.  

#### Dependencies

To install the Shield scanner successfully on a Mac or Windows 10/11 OS, WSL (Windows only) and Docker Desktop need to be installed and available.  Once Docker Desktop is installed, make sure the Docker engine is started before attempting to install the Shield Scanner.

- [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

#### Install & Configure the Shield Scanner

1. Download and unzip this repository: [Shield Scanner](https://github.com/Shield-Cyber/ShieldCyber-REST-API/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Unzip the folder contents
3. Navigate to the *ShieldCyber-REST-API-main* folder
4. Open the *example.env* file within a text editor & change the `yourpasswordhere` value and save
5. Re-name the *example.env* file to *.env*
6. Open a command prompt as administrator, and navigate to the *ShieldCyber-REST-API-main* folder
7. Install and start the Shield scanner with the following command: `docker compose up -d`
