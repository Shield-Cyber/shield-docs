title: "Active Directory Collection"
description: "The ability to collect the AD information for a specific AD environment requires the Shield installation of a **Shield Service** to collect the users, groups, and computers objects and associated attributes.  Shield has a standalone PowerShell script within the [**Deployment**](https://platform.shieldcyber.io/deployment/identity-security) (Identity-Security) page that users can access."
---

### Deployment

<Note>The Shield Cyber Services must be installed on currently supported Windows Operating Systems, e.g., Windows Server 2016 and higher; Windows 10 and higher.</Note>

To deploy the Shield Active Directory (AD) service, navigate to the [**Deployment**](https://platform.shieldcyber.io/deployment/identity-security) (Identity-Security) page and the Shield platform has a pre-generated deployment PowerShell script that can be executed on a single domain-joined Windows server or workstation. 

Once at the [**Deployment**](https://platform.shieldcyber.io/deployment/identity-security) page, to generate the deployment PowerShell script, enter a **Location**, and the script will be displayed in the text box.

### Troubleshooting

If there are errors when launching the PowerShell script, users can troubleshoot further by downloading the Shield Cyber MSI to the domain-joined Windows host, and perform the following commands one-by-one or together creating a PowerShell (.ps1) file and executing them together.

1. Download the Shield Cyber Services MSI here: [Shield Cyber Services MSI](https://stshieldcyberprod.blob.core.windows.net/installers/windows/services/ShieldCyberServices.msi)
2. Run the commands below or save them to a PowerShell (.ps1) file to execute on the target hosts:
```
# OPTION FOR SCRIPTING - Set the execution policy temporarily for this process to ensure the script runs.  Users should not need to perform this step if they are executing the commands one-by-one.
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force

# Path to the MSI installer, assuming it is already in the designated location
$destination = "C:\Users\Public\Downloads\ShieldCyberServices.msi"

# Arguments for installing the MSI
$msiArguments = '/i "C:\Users\Public\Downloads\ShieldCyberServices.msi" SHIELD-LOCATION-NAME="CREATE-LOCATION" SHIELD_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="INSERT-SUBSCRIPTION-ID" SHIELD_SUBSCRIPTION_API_KEY="INSERT-API-KEY" INSTALL_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY="Yes" /quiet'

# Start the MSI installation
Start-Process msiexec -ArgumentList $msiArguments -Wait

# Sleep for ten seconds to ensure that installation processes have settled
Start-Sleep -Seconds 10

# Start the specified service, assuming it is correctly named in the script; adjust as necessary
Net Start ShieldCyber.Agent.AD.exe -Wait
```
<Note> Please update the file path location, as well as the SHIELD-LOCATION-NAM (user created value), INSERT-SUBSCRIPTION-ID (Subscription ID), and INSERT-API-KEY values within the script above</Note>

If there are additional issues, please send the errors received from these commands to support@shieldcyber.io.

### Independent Service Installation

Alternatively, all Shield services can be installed by downloading the Shield Microsoft Installer (MSI) and launched directly on the 

Download the guided Shield MSI [here](https://stshieldcyberprod.blob.core.windows.net/installers/windows/services/ShieldCyberServices.msi) and run as Administrator on a Windows host within the desired internal network. Once the MSI is downloaded and executed, you will be prompted to begin the installation:

Click **next** to decide where to install the files for the services:
<Frame type="glass">
  <img src="/images/agent-install-location.png" />
</Frame>


On the next screen, you will need to select the services to install.  The following services are available:
- **Active Directory**: Active Directory collection module
- **Nessus**: Nessus Professional integration service installation
- **Shield**: Shield network scanner module

<Frame type="glass">
  <img src="/images/agent-service-selection.png" />
</Frame>

Select **next** to install all dependencies and proceed to the service configuration for the choices that were selected.

Insert the following in the **Active Directory** service configuration: 
- **Location Name**: Name a location for the specific network where you will be deploying.  This can be any value, however, it will need to be *distinct* for within each subscription.  **This should be the same value as the Shield scanner configuration within the next step.**
- **Subscription ID**: Insert the Subscription ID for where the scanner location should be created.
- **API Key**: Enter the designated API key for the subscription.  This value can be copied directly from the platform on the [Subscriptions](https://platform.shieldcyber.io/account) page.

<Warning>Please note, users have the ability to regenerate the subscription API Key, however, once this is regenerated, the previous API Key(s) will no longer work.  To re-connect any services utilizing old API Key(s), please modify the existing API Key and restart any deployed services.</Warning>

Click **next** to proceed to input the credentials that the **Active Directory** service will run under the context of:

<Frame type="glass">
  <img src="/images/agent-ad-credentials.png" />
</Frame>

The credentials will need to be entered in the following format: 
- **User Name**: *DOMAIN\Username*
- **Domain**: *domain.local*
- **Password**: *Password* (If you are using a GMSA/MSA, this can be left empty)


<Info>Shield recommends setting up a group managed service account (GMSA) with limited permissions on the domain to run the **Active Directory** service.  To view guidance on creating a GMSA, please review the following guidance from Microsoft [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/getting-started-with-group-managed-service-accounts).</Info>

Click **next** to proceed to install all the Shield AD service and finalize the installation: 


<Frame type="glass">
  <img src="/images/agent-finish.png" />
</Frame>

To verify that the **Active Directory** service installed correctly, you can open the services pane (`Windows Key + run.exe` and enter `services.msc`), and the **Shield Cyber AD Agent** should be running:

### Results

Once the service is installed, the AD objects and risks associated with the objects should start to populate within the [Identity Security](https://platform.shieldcyber.io/isecurity/overview) module within the Shield platform.
